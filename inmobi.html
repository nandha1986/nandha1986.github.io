The core of the App would be to provide “Opinions on things that matter from people who matter”.  The app would help users discover products through influencers. Influencers would be experts in their on field. Influencer would recommend products through videos and the videos will be more one minute high definition. The videos would be snackable and limited (only 7 videos for a day).  
 <br>

<h5>Opinions </h5>In the form of videos<br>

<h5>People </h5>who would drive the discovery they could be "Experts" or “Friends”. <br>
<h5>Products </h5>It could apply for any product from a nike shoe to a travel experience<br>

              <h4>Journey</h4><p>

- Ten Concepts of the app built
- Tested with 100 Users over a perios of a year</p>

 <h4>Methodology</h4>
              <p> I used the google sprint method for this project. I used this method because in this project we had to simultaneously bring in business, design, technology and user testing together to validate the idea. <br><br>

Monday - Brainstorm the areas of focus and ideas to be built<br>
Tuesday - Sketching and wireframe <br>
Wednesday - Make decisions to turn idea into hypothesis<br>
Thursday - High Fidelity Prototype <br>
Friday - Testing with 5 users to get feedback.<br>
Weekend - Analyse the feedback and use as input for the next session.<br><br>

            <img src="img/inmobi/dis3.jpg" class="img-responsive"><br>
            </p>
<h3>Phase 2 </h3>
<p>Having iterated on 12 different concepts we decided on the Opinion concept. Next step was to conme up with quick prototpyes for this concept. We finalised on the OPINION variant.<br></p><br>
           

<h4>Final Concept</h4>
<p>Video Only Opinions
Full screen portrait video - We also knew for the fact that Portrait videos are more engaging, we thought why not have a complete portrait video experience instead of a landscape video, partly because portrait is purely engaging and not many have done it.
This screen below shown was the first variant we tried which was completely a video experience. Once we built it we wanted to test how users receive the app, so we conducted a user testing session with user.
</p>
<br>
              <h4>Key Tasks and Goals</h4>
              <p> •Help Users Discover Expert Videos Content
              <br>•These videos will be available at 7 Pm everyday
               <br>•Really focus on the video content.
              <br>•Based on the videos, users will see related high quality content
                <br>•Users will be able to save and share a video.
                <br>•There will be a profile section to access these section.


                 <br><br></p>


                <h4>Design Principles</h4>
                    <p> I defined three design principles to make sure we take the right design decisions. Also, to bring a sense of prioritization for the things that we do. 
<br>
                        • Bold and Graphical <br>
                        • Quality over Quantity<br>
                         • Delightful Engaging Experience

                     
                      
                      <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h4>SKetching and WIrframes</h4>
                    <p>O
Mid Fidelity WIreframes 

After brainstorming and sketching our design we decided on the direction that we wanted to take, Since video was out primary USP . We wanted to give the best experience for the users to we took a bold move of opening the app to a full screen edge to edge portrait video.  
                     <img src="img/inmobi/wireframe.jpg" class="img-responsive">

                    <img src="img/inmobi/14.jpg" class="img-responsive"><br>
                    <img src="img/inmobi/15.jpg" class="img-responsive"><br><br></p>
                      <h4>Visual Designs</h4>
                      <p>Our target users were definitely between the age group of 18 - 25. So our visual language had to be bold and graphical. Which meant we rely on typography and engaging video. SImply put we wanted the content to take the front seat and users had to take minimum effort in interaction with the app. 
</p>

                        </p>
                       <div class="text-left">
<h4>User Testing</h4>
                      <p>Testing was a weekly effort were we invited college student to be part of the sessions. It was mostly iterative testing were post sessions we would quickly gather for a brainstorming session to collect all the stakeholders feedback to and decide on the next set of actions.
